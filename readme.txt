Analysis on US Universities Data and Modelling Tuition

Short description:

Machine learning is a core sub-area of Artificial Intelligence (AI). ML applications learn from experience (or to be accurate, data) like humanswe do without direct programming. When exposed to new data, these applications learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. In other words, machine learning involves computers finding insightful information without being told where to look. Instead, they do this by leveraging algorithms that learn from data in an iterative process. 

The concept of machine learning has been around for a long time (think of the World War II Enigma Machine, for example). However, the idea of automating the application of complex mathematical calculations to big data has only been around for several years, though it’s now gaining more momentum. 

The Machine Learning process starts with inputting training data into the selected algorithm. Training data being known or unknown data to develop the final Machine Learning algorithm. The type of training data input does impact the algorithm, and that concept will be covered further momentarily. New input data is fed into the machine learning algorithm to test whether the algorithm works correctly. The prediction and results are then checked against each other. 
If the prediction and results don’t match, the algorithm is re-trained multiple times until the data scientist gets the desired outcome. This enables the machine learning algorithm to continually learn on its own and produce the optimal answer, gradually increasing in accuracy over time. 
 
Types of Machine Learning 
Supervised learning: You supervise the machine while training it to work on its own. This requires labeled training data. 
Unsupervised learning: It requires training data, but it won’t be labeled. 
Reinforcement learning: The system learns on its own. 

This project would be centered around Supervised learning.

Dataset being used:

US Universities Data (1300 cases, 30 variables): This dataset is taken from the 1995 U.S. News
& World Report’s Guide to America’s Best Colleges. Information on around 30 variables for each
of over 1300 American colleges and universities is given. See the link
“http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/colleges/readme” for details. You could pre- dict several variables
including public/private.
